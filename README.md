# Blinkit Sales Analysis Project

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from Blinkit to uncover trends, identify key performing outlets, and understand category-wise performance. It was built using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Excel, and Power BI.

---

## Objective
- Analyze sales across different outlet establishment years
- Visualize product category-wise performance
- Identify trends and generate actionable insights

---

##  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicates and null values
- Standardized column formats (e.g., date, numeric conversions)
- Grouped data by 'Outlet Establishment Year' and 'Product Category'

---

##  Key Metrics & KPIs
- Total Sales
- Sales by Year
- Average Sales per Outlet
- Contribution % by Category
- Year-on-Year Growth

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Excel**: Pivot tables, formulas, conditional formatting, slicers
- **Power BI**: Data modeling, DAX, dynamic visualizations, KPIs

---

##  Key Insights
- Outlets established in years like 1999 and 2007 had the highest sales
- Certain product categories dominated the sales contribution
- Seasonal and trend-based patterns were discovered

---

##  Project Learnings
- Hands-on experience with end-to-end data analysis
- Working with real-world datasets to build business dashboards
- Data visualization best practices

---

##  Future Enhancements
- Add predictive analytics for sales forecasting
- Integrate customer data for segmentation
- Deploy dashboard using Power BI Service for real-time access

## Interview Preparation – Sample Q&A

### 1. What was the objective of this project?
To analyze Blinkit’s sales performance across outlets and product categories, identify trends, and derive business insights.

### 2. What were your key findings?
- Highest sales were linked to outlets from specific years
- Some product categories had disproportionate sales

### 3. How did you preprocess your data?
Using Pandas and Power Query, I removed nulls, cleaned column types, and grouped by meaningful segments.

### 4. What KPIs did you use?
Total Sales, Category Contributions, Outlet Trends, YoY Growth.

### 5. What tools did you use?
Python for analysis, Excel for quick summaries, and Power BI for dashboards.

### 6. How would you scale this in production?
Use live data sources (SQL), scheduled refreshes in Power BI, and predictive models.
